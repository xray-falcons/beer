```I do hereby declare that the Xray Falcons have democratically selected the above idea for their Capstone Project. This project (which has yet to be named) will allow users to tag beers with predefined categories to describe the drinking experience. This information may power a recommendation engine for a user to see what else they might like, and to enrich the descriptive data to inform others. Our technology stack will include React Native, Firebase, and GraphQL. Reach goals will include data visualizations with D3 and OCR to identify beer by label image.```
